### Hey, I'm Caroline Goulart! Nice to meet you. :)

I'm passionate about how technology can change people's lives, so it motivates me to be a continuous learner. :heart:

I'm an Engineer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and I work as Back-end Java Developer (TDD, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, APIs Rest, Microservices Architecture, SQL, and MariaDB), but I'm also experienced in Python, JavaScript, NodeJs, ReactJs, React Native, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git. I'm fluent and certified in English.<br/>

### What I'm focusing on :woman_technologist:

Currently improving my skills in ReactJS, NodeJs, React Native, and TypeScript.<br/>
