### Hey, I'm Caroline Goulart! Nice to meet you. :)

I'm passionate about how technology can change people's lives, so it motivates me to be a continuous learner. :heart:

I'm an Engineer based in São Paulo, Brazil, and I work as Back-end Java Developer (TDD, Spring Boot, Hibernate/Spring Data JPA, APIs Rest, Microservices Architecture, SQL), but I'm also experienced in Python, JavaScript(TypeScript), NodeJs, ReactJs, and React Native.<br/>

### What I'm focusing on :woman_technologist:

Currently improving my skills in ReactJS (Context API, Redux), NodeJs (Yarn, TypeORM), and React Native.<br/>

### Find me elsewhere :earth_americas:
