### Hey, I'm Caroline! Nice to meet you. :)

I'm passionate about how technology can change people's lives, so it motivates me to be a continuous learner. :heart:

I'm an Engineer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and I work as Back-end Java Developer (Spring Framework, Spring Data JPA, APIs Rest, Microservices Architecture, RESTFul APIs, SQL and NoSQL databases, event streaming with Kafka, and Git), but I'm also experienced in JavaScript(TypeScript), NodeJs, ReactJs, and React Native.<br/>

### What I'm focusing on :woman_technologist:

Currently improving my skills in ReactJs (NextJs, Context API), NodeJs, and React Native.<br/>
