### Hey, I'm Caroline Goulart! Nice to meet you. :)

I'm passionate about how technology can change people's lives, so it motivates me to be a continuous learner. :heart:

I'm an Engineer graduated from PUCRS and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, EUA. I'm currently working with Java (TDD, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, APIs Rest, Microservices Architecture, SQL, and MariaDB), but I'm also experienced in Python, JavaScript, NodeJs, ReactJs, React Native, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git. I'm fluent and certified in English.<br/>
